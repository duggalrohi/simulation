Stanford Test 5
===============

This model is run in Brynhild using the TOUGH2 compatiblity mode (T2Fafnir)

- Use generateT2.py to generate the TOUGH2 input file in the T2 and Brynhild subfolders
- Run the TOUGH2 model and rename the output file to T2/TOUGH2.out (for your convenience this file already exists)
- Run the Brynhild 3D model
- Use plotResults.py for comparing the Brynhild to the TOUGH2 output
