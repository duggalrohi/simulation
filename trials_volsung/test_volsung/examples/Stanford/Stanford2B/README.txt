Stanford Test 2B
================

- Use generateT2.py to generate the TOUGH2 input file in the T2 subfolder
- Run the TOUGH2 model and rename the output file to T2/TOUGH2.out (for your convenience this file already exists)
- Run the Brynhild 3D model
- Use plotResults.py for comparing the Brynhild to the TOUGH2 output
